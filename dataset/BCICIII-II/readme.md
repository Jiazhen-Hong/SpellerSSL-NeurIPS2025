# BCICIII-II Dataset Notes

Due to GitHub size limitations, we only provide the ground truth character labels here.  
The full dataset can be downloaded directly from [BBCI Competition III](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/).

The aggregation algorithm is available in the main directory (`Aggregation.py`) and can be applied directly to the raw dataset.  
The aggregation size *G* can be freely adjusted.
